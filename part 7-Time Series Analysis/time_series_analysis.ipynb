    "#### 1. **Introduction to Time Series Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Analysis** is a statistical technique that deals with data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. The goal is to analyze patterns such as trends, seasonality, and cycles in time-ordered data and make forecasts for future points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications of Time Series Analysis**:\n",
    "- Stock market price predictions\n",
    "- Weather forecasting\n",
    "- Sales forecasting\n",
    "- Traffic analysis (e.g., web traffic, vehicle traffic)\n",
    "- Anomaly detection in time-dependent data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Components of a Time Series**\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series is typically composed of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend**: The long-term movement in the data (upward, downward, or constant).\n",
    "2. **Seasonality**: Regular patterns or fluctuations in the data that occur at specific periods (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly).\n",
    "3. **Cyclicality**: Repeating patterns that occur over irregular intervals due to business or economic cycles.\n",
    "4. **Noise**: Random variations in the data that cannot be explained by trend, seasonality, or cyclicality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Types of Time Series Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Autoregressive (AR) Model**: The AR model uses previous values from the time series to predict future values. It assumes that current values depend on a combination of past values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Y_t = c + \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \\dots + \\phi_p Y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_t\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Moving Average (MA) Model**: The MA model predicts future values based on past forecast errors, smoothing out the noise.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Y_t = c + \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\theta_2 \\epsilon_{t-2} + \\dots + \\theta_q \\epsilon_{t-q} + \\epsilon_t\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Combines AR and MA models and includes a differencing component to make the time series stationary.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - AR (p): Autoregressive part (previous values).\n",
    "   - I (d): Differencing to make data stationary.\n",
    "   - MA (q): Moving average part (errors).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   ARIMA(p, d, q)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)**: Extends ARIMA by adding seasonal components to account for seasonality in the data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Where $ s $ is the number of periods in each season.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exponential Smoothing (ETS)**: Uses weighted averages of past observations, where recent observations have higher weights.\n",
    "   - Simple Exponential Smoothing (for stationary data).\n",
    "   - Holt’s Linear Trend Method (for data with a trend).\n",
    "   - Holt-Winters (for data with both trend and seasonality).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Step-by-Step Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider a dataset of monthly sales data for a company, and we want to forecast future sales based on past sales:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Month  | Sales  |\n",
