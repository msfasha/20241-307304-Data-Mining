    "\n",
    "- **Antecedent (LHS)**: The item(s) on the left-hand side of the rule.\n",
    "- **Consequent (RHS)**: The item(s) on the right-hand side of the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example rule:  \n",
    "**{Milk, Bread} → {Butter}**\n",

    "\n",
    "To evaluate the strength of association rules, we use three key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Support**:  \n",
    "   The proportion of transactions in which the item(s) appear.  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "   Support(A → B) = \\frac{\\text{Number of transactions containing both A and B}}{\\text{Total number of transactions}}\n",
    "  $$\n",

    "2. **Confidence**:  \n",
    "   The probability that B is purchased given A is already purchased.  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "   Confidence(A → B) = \\frac{\\text{Support(A and B)}}{\\text{Support(A)}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lift**:  \n",
    "   The ratio of the observed support to the expected support if A and B were independent. Lift shows the strength of the rule beyond random chance.  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "   Lift(A → B) = \\frac{\\text{Confidence(A → B)}}{\\text{Support(B)}}\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Antecedents**: The item(s) on the left-hand side (LHS) of the rule. These are the \"if\" conditions.\n",
    "2. **Consequents**: The item(s) on the right-hand side (RHS) of the rule. These are the \"then\" conditions.\n",
    "3. **Support**: The proportion of transactions that contain both the antecedents and the consequents.\n",
    "4. **Confidence**: The probability that the consequent(s) will occur given that the antecedent(s) have occurred.\n",
    "5. **Lift**: The strength of the rule relative to random chance. If the lift is greater than 1, it indicates a positive correlation between the antecedents and consequents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting Each Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down some of the rows to see how they can be interpreted:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rule 0: **{Milk} → {Bread}**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support**: 0.6  \n",
    "  This means that 60% of all transactions include both *Milk* and *Bread*.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Confidence**: 0.75  \n",

    "  \n",
    "- **Lift**: 0.9375  \n",
    "  Since the lift is less than 1, it indicates that buying *Milk* slightly *decreases* the likelihood of buying *Bread* compared to chance. The rule might not be particularly strong or valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rule 3: **{Bread} → {Butter}**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support**: 0.6  \n",
    "  This means that 60% of transactions contain both *Bread* and *Butter*.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Confidence**: 0.75  \n",
    "  If a customer buys *Bread*, there is a 75% chance that they will also buy *Butter*.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Lift**: 1.25  \n",
    "  A lift greater than 1 suggests a positive correlation between *Bread* and *Butter*, meaning customers are more likely to buy *Butter* when they buy *Bread* than by random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rule 5: **{Milk, Bread} → {Butter}**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support**: 0.4  \n",
    "  This means that 40% of all transactions include *Milk*, *Bread*, and *Butter* together.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Confidence**: 0.67  \n",
    "  When a customer buys both *Milk* and *Bread*, there is a 67% chance they will also buy *Butter*.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Lift**: 1.11  \n",
    "  Since the lift is greater than 1, it indicates a positive correlation between buying *Milk* and *Bread* together and also buying *Butter*. The rule is somewhat useful but not extremely strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Interpretation Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Support**: A rule with high support occurs frequently in the dataset, making it potentially useful for common patterns (but may be too general if support is too high).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **High Confidence**: Rules with high confidence are good predictors—when the antecedent occurs, the consequent is likely to occur as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lift Greater Than 1**: A lift value greater than 1 indicates a strong association between the antecedent and consequent. The higher the lift, the stronger the association.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these metrics, you can determine which rules are the most meaningful. In practice, you want rules with relatively high support, confidence, and lift to make effective business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{Bread} → {Butter}** could be used for targeted promotions. Since customers who buy *Bread* are more likely to buy *Butter* (with a lift of 1.25), you might offer a discount on *Butter* to customers purchasing *Bread*."
